miRvial - miRNAs via integrative analysis

* Programs Requirement
	Running miRvial requires a GNU-like environment. It should be possible to
	run miRvial on a Linux or Mac OS.  

	miRvial requires other external tools which can be found
	bowtie	http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml
	RNAfold http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA
	java	http://www.java.com/en/download/

* compile
	cd src/
	javac *.java


* Running
	cd scripts/
	** configure specific file location
	./run.sh
	vim topre.map.align_1	( topre.map.align_1 is the final result )

	the run.sh takes five inputs
	$1 bowtie-built index of the database. e.g mouse genome index
	$2 fasta file of the sequencing reads 
	$3 a list of parameters used in the program (see next section)

	optional inputs
	$4 the miRNA annotation file 
	$5 the number of mappable loci where a read can map


* format in fasta file
	>seq_x100
	CTAGTTTTTTTTAAAAAAA


* parameter file

	# maximum read length 
	max_read_len=24

	# minimum read length
	min_read_len=20

	# mimimum copy number 
	mincopy = 10

	# directory of genome
	E.g gendir = /project/cic2/database/mm9/

	# if genome has multiple files, isDiR = ture; otherwise, isDir = false  
	E.g isDir = true

	# length of each slide (from 5' to 3')
	slideLen = 20

	# size of sliding window
	slidespan = 120


	# If positions of two reads are less than gapLen, they will be considered as one cluster
	gapLen = 50

	# the size of extension to both ends of each clusters
	extLen = 200

	# the minimum number of reads in a cluster
	mincopy = 10

	# minimum of hairpin folding energy
	mindg = 18

	# minimum length of miRNA-miRNA duplex
	hplen = 18
